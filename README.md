## 👨‍🏫 Supervisor

Dr. Priya Ranjan Muduli

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- FaceNet: Deep learning model for face identification
- OpenCV: Python framework for image processing
- Face_Recognition library
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) technique
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier

## ✨ Key Features

- Face detection and recognition
- Liveness detection using eye blink analysis
- Real-time attendance recording
- Support for multiple camera sources (mobile, laptop, Raspberry Pi)

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Image capture from device camera
2. Face detection using Dlib's HOG technique
3. Face identification using FaceNet with triplet loss function
4. Classification using SVM for rapid database querying
5. Liveness detection through eye blink analysis
